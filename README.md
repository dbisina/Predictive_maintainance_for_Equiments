# Predictive_maintainance_for_Equiments


## Focus

The primary focus of the project is on applying data science techniques, particularly predictive maintenance, to address challenges in Industry 4.0. The aim is to predict when a machine might fail, allowing for proactive maintenance and substantial cost savings.

## Motivation

The motivation for predictive maintenance lies in the consideration that the cost of addressing a specific component issue is significantly lower than the cost of repairing or replacing an entire machine. By installing sensors to monitor machine conditions and collecting relevant data, industries can optimize their maintenance processes.

## Dataset

The project leverages the AI4I Predictive Maintenance Dataset from the UCI Repository. This dataset provides the necessary information to develop predictive models for machine failures.

## Objectives

The project is designed with two core objectives:

1. **Identifying Machine Failures:** Develop models to identify whether a machine is on the verge of failure.
2. **Determining Failure Nature:** Determine the nature of the impending fault, i.e., understand the specific component or issue leading to the potential failure.

## Project Flow

### Data Exploration

The project begins with exploring the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying truth.

### Preprocessing Techniques

Various preprocessing techniques are applied to ready the data for predictive algorithms.

### Predictive Models

The machine learning models used in the project include:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Random Forest Classifier (RFC)

Additionally, ensemble models and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are incorporated for a more comprehensive analysis.

### Features

The features used in the analysis are sourced from the AI4I Predictive Maintenance Dataset.

## Prerequisites

The project requires the following libraries and versions:

- matplotlib==3.7.0
- pandas==1.5.3
- scikit-learn==1.2.1
- numpy==1.23.5
- seaborn==0.12.2
- Python==3.10.9

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn tensorflow
```

## Conclusion

The project concludes with an extensive comparison of the results obtained from the predictive models. Performance is assessed using relevant metrics, and the interpretability of the models is evaluated.

This project showcases the application of data science methodologies to address real-world challenges in predictive maintenance, emphasizing the importance of Industry 4.0 principles.
